      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <h4>Welcome to Little Gems Doggy Day Care!</h4>
      <p>Yes, that’s right a day care, pet service especially for dogs! </p>
      <p>Hi, I’m Helen, I am the founder of Little Gems doggy day care. I have had experience with dogs for over 30 years now! I am genuinely passionate about dogs: dog behavior, dog psychology and dog training. I have over five years experience working with dogs and Jane Harvey, at Harvey's Doggy Day Care. I enjoyed working with Jane so much that I had the idea of running my own doggy day care. And with the help of my family, we have set up Little Gems Doggy Day Care!</p>

      <h4>We are a family business - all of whom' Love Dogs!'</h4>
      <p>We offer a pet service similar to childcare, only for dogs! Simply drop your dog off with us in the morning, then pick them up on your way home, it’s that simple! Your dog will have a great day!</p>
      <p>You would be able to enjoy your day, guilt free! Knowing that your dog is being fully taken care of and having fun! Making new friends, playing, sniffing, interacting &amp; socialising with other dogs, instead of being left in the house, on his own all day. You would not have to worry about letting him out for a wee (in the day) or feeding him at lunch, your dog would be fully taken care of at our dog day care! </p>

      <p>At Little Gems, we have a safe and enclosed outdoor space for dogs, complete with sand pits, ball pits, tunnels and plenty of toys to keep your dog occupied. Inside we have a nice big space for more playing with toys and chews as well as sofas and dog beds for when they need a rest!</p>
      <p>We can only accept dogs that have been fully vaccinated (including Kennel Cough) neutered/spayed (this does not apply to dogs under 6 months old) be well socialised and friendly. All play is supervised.</p>

      <h4>Testimonial</h4>
      <p>"We can highly recommend the services provided by everyone at Little Gems. We have been taking our dog Lily to Doggy Day care at Little Gems since it opened and we have been really pleased with how well she is looked after and has been accepted into their family environment. As well as interacting with the other dogs, Helen looks after, Lily's social skills and her training has improved immensely, all credit to Helen. Lily loves to come to Little Gems, thank you for providing a safe and fun environment for Lily to be in whilst she is in your care"</p>
      <p>Sue and Ady, Lily's owners.</p>
