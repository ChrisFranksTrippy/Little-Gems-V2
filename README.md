## Information Architecture and Accessibility

The information on the site has been organised into sections that fit onto each page. Within the pages them selfs information is seperated into smaller sections of text and seperatered by full width images. The height of the images is also set to show a small amount of the next section of text to encurage the user to scroll down the rest of the page. Important sections of text are emboldened to stand out, such as opening hours and location. 
All content can be accessed from every page using the navigation menu. 
The gallery page contains a selection of images that, on mobile devices, contain arrows to indicate the user can scroll. When the use reachers the ends of the scrollable section, one of the arrows will fade away indicating the end of the section, this functionality is hiden on desktop devices as a scroll bar clearly displays all of these functions.
All image tags within the site contain alt tags.

## PARC

### Proximity
The gallery images are all next to each other, no margins or padding to ensure each picture is can be easily reached. This also adds an element of continuity to the overall styling. On the other pages, all content is evenly spaced and consistenly separated by an image. Minimal action is required by the user to locate the next content. The burger and back to top buttons are always available when necessary, always in proximity, making use easy.

### Alignment
All content on mobile pages is the same width, buttons are consistently aligned in place with each other, even when scrolling. Text is evenly spaced. Gallery, all images are the same size and in line Allowing for a smooth experience and easy access. About page is all centrally aligned, even map is same size as elements on other pages (consistent alignment)

### Repetition
Constant styling and colour scheme is used. All images and text are the same size throughout. Same animations used on all images in the galery and when enlarging

### Contrast
Bright and dark greens are used to distinguish content and add breaks in between white content and images. Current page is highlighted, contrasting against not active pages, clearly showing user where they are.

## Third Party Code

All code is my own, only influenced by third parties. None of their actual code is used.

## API

### Google Maps API

The Google Maps API is used on the contact page to display the area in which the business is located, the exact are is not marked as the business does not like to give the address for security purposes.

### Dog.ceo

The Dog.ceo API is an API that is used on the contact page of the site to reterive a list of different dog breeds and random images of these indervidual breeds. The user must give thier contact details as well as what breed of dog they own, as this will affect their chances of being accepted due to the average size of the breed.
